    <h2>About</h2>
    <img src="images/Photograph of JH.jpg" alt="Photograph of Jacob Heathfield">
    <p>Growing up in the Greater Toronto Area, I initially did not see myself becoming an artist. It was only after taking a course in high school when I began to make representational painting with acrylics. Upon entering university, I began to experiment more with different types of media, themes and concepts. It was also at this time during the early 2020's in which I felt a substantial increase in anti-Asian racism, both physical and online.
      That particular "wave" of discriminatory hatred can certainly be attributed to the popularization of anti-China and anti-Chinese rhetoric from prominent right-wing populist figures in North America. <br /> <br />
      I became obsessed with wanting to understand why such bigotry exists, and why (in the back of my mind) I never *fully* felt belonged as a Canadian with an Indonesian background. Through this process of trying to learn and understand the dynamics behind prominent issues, have I gotten to learn about the unique stories and perspectives from friends, scholars and figures around the world. My latest art projects have attemped to analyze and shed light on these issues related to concepts like colonialism and capitalism in a manner that often provokes viewers to think differently and learn something new. <br /> <br />

      The reason I continue to explore all kinds of injustices in my pieces is to demonstrate the common themes and intersections between issues. I hope that these pieces will help educate my audience to expand their knowledge and empathy towards the struggles of marginalized groups. <br /><br />
